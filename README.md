# Nueral-Network-0-or-1-Digit-detector-
#By Rahul.G

Training provided from the MNIST DATABASE -> http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Developed using functions from NUMPY

This code is for a Nueral Network, which can detect and distinguish between the digits 0 and 1, on a grayscale 28x28 image

The formation of the network's nuerons is:  

784 -> 5 -> 1 

This nueral network, uses gradient descent (non-stochastic), in order to train itself.

The compression function used is the sigmoid function (logistic curve)
